## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Changmin, an avid traveler who loves meeting new people.

My primary interest lies in Algebraic Topology, but I also have experience in cryptography, Competitive Programming (CP), and backend development.

Iâ€™m always on the lookout for a friend to share a cup of coffee and engage in interesting conversations. Letâ€™s chat!

## Projects

- zk-fft: An FFT zero-knowledge circuit implemented using the nil compiler (now deprecated) and RISC Zero. Not only is the general      Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm implemented, but also a modified FFT algorithm suitable for ZK environments.
- torch2circom: A tool developed to bridge the gap between machine learning and zero-knowledge proof technologies. It allows            developers to generate proof generators for their ML models, which can be used in smart contracts to verify the correctness of 
  model execution.
- Circom-TFHE-RS: A tool that translates Circom circuits into TFHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) equivalents. This project aims to   
  bridge the gap between Circom, a popular framework for creating and working with arithmetic circuits, and TFHE-rs, a Rust 
  implementation of TFHE for boolean and integer arithmetics over encrypted data.

## Awards & Programs
